The Kiop Ransomware 
Kiop is a ransomware program that belongs to the Djvu ransomware family. This malware has been 
discovered recently. 
 
How it Spreads 
Ransomware spreads using different techniques such as spam emails and fake torrent sites. After infection, it 
encrypts files with the ".kiop" extension. For example, it renames 'one[.]jpg' to 'one[.]jpg[.]kiop.' The 
ransomware creates a '_readme[.]txt' file as a ransom note. This ransomware may be spread alongside Vidar 
and RedLine. The ransom note dropped by Kiop includes payment and contact details with suggested that 
victims make contact with the attackers within 72 hours to avoid paying $980 instead of $490 for the 
decryption tool. It urges that it is not possible to unlock files without these tools. Further, the '_readme[.]txt' file 
mentions that victims can send a single locked file for free unlocking. The attackers can be communicated via 
email using support@freshmail[.]top or datarestorehelp@airmail[.]cc address. However, paying the ransom is 
never a suggested thing to do. 
 
How it Succeeded 
Ransomware groups use numerous attack vectors such as spam email and fake torrent sites to compromise 
more victims.


Recent Activity 
Kiop ransomware is found targeting Windows system users. After infection, it asks victims to pay the ransom 
for decryption. Further, the victims cannot use their locked files anymore.
